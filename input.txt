Interpretive Comments on Test
Suggest treatment with antiviral drugs. There are three FDA-approved influenza antiviral drugs recommended by CDC. The brand names for these
are Tamiflu® (generic name oseltamivir), Relenza® (generic name zanamivir), and Rapivab® (generic name peramivir), Tamiflu® is available as a pill
or liquid, and Relenza® is a powder that is inhaled (Relenza® is not for people with breathing problems like asthma or COPD, for example.) Rapivab®
is administered intravenously by a health care provider. To treat flu, Tamiflu® and Relenza® are usually taken for 5day, although people hospitalized
with the flu may need the medicine for longer than 5 days, Rapivab® is given intravenously for 15 minutes to 30 minutes.
For Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A); use first line antibiotics; penicillin. If resistance-erythromycin, azithromycin cephalosporin, clindamycin.

Intended Use
The detection and identification of specific nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory infection aids in the
diagnosis of respiratory viral and/or bacterial infections, if used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological information. The RPP test is a
LDT test and is not FDA approved. The RPP test is a qualitative nucleic acid multiplex diagnostic test intended for use on an Applied Biosystems™
QuantStudio™ 12K system for One-Step RT-qPCR. This assay can simultaneously detect and identify nucleic acids from multiple respiratory
pathogens present from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), obtained from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory infections. The
following bacteria and viruses/subtypes are identified using the RPP test: Influenza A (Influenza A H1, Influenza A H3, Influenza A 2009 H1N1),
Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) (subtypes A and B), Parainfluenza Virus (PIV) (subtypes 1, 2, and 3), Human Metapneumovirus
(hMPV), Human Rhinovirus (HRV), Adenovirus, Coronavirus, (strains NL63, OC43, HKU-1, and 229E), Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma
pneumoniae, Bordetella holmesii, Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus
pyogenes (group A).

Methodology
The Purified RNA/DNA is isolated from the nasopharyngeal patient specimen and loaded onto a Vaginal Tract Microbiota TaqMan® Open Arrays.
These Open arrays can detect and identify a broad range of respiratory pathogens, simultaneously, within a sample extract and allows for 24 to 48
samples depending on the number of targets to be amplified. Each sub-array is made of 64 through holes which contain the primer sets for
amplification of the specific target. During amplification, sequence specific oligonucleotides probes (dually labelled with a fluorophore and
quencher) are allowed to hybridize to a specific DNA template. The 5’-3’ exonuclease activity of DBA polymerase during elongation cleaves the
fluorophore from being quenched on the oligonucleotide probe, causing the fluorophore to be excited, emitting fluorescence. The accumulation of
fluorescence for each sample, in each well of the array, is measure by the instrument software during each cycle of amplification, directly
corresponding to amplification of target sequence. The Applied Biosystem™ QuantStudio™ 12K system software provides a quality scores and
confidence values for each assay in each well, for each sample.

Limitations
Negative results do not preclude respiratory viral infection and should not be used as a sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient
management decisions. Positive results do not rule out bacterial infections, or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the
definite cause of disease. The use of additional laboratory testing (e.g., bacterial, and viral culture, immunofluorescence, and radiography) and
clinical presentation must be taken into consideration in the final diagnosis of respiratory viral infection.
Performance characteristics for Influenza A were established during the 2010/2011 influenza season when Influenza A 2009 H1N1 and H3N2 were
the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. When other Influenza A viruses emerge, performance characteristics may vary.
